            <h3>What is Join?</h3>

            <p>
                <span class="c-lightblue">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a
                dedicated student as part of his web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.<br>
                <br>
                Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
                work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). <span class="c-lightblue">Join</span> leverages the
                principles of kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual
                interface.<br>
                <br>
                It is important to note that <span class="c-lightblue">Join</span> is designed as an educational
                exercise and is not intended for extensive business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible

            <h3>How to use it</h3>

            <div class="column-16">
                <span>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use <span class="c-lightblue">Join</span>:</span>

                <div class="item-cont">
                    <span class="item">1.</span>

                        <h4>Exploring the Board</h4>
                        <p>
                            When you log in to <span class="c-lightblue">Join</span>, you'll find a default board. This
                            board represents your project and contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress",
                            “Await feedback” and "Done".
                        </p>
                    </article>
                </div>

                <div class="item-cont">
                    <span class="item">2.</span>
                    <article>
                        <h4>Creating Contacts</h4>
                        <p>
                            In <span class="c-lightblue">Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your
                            projects. Go to the "Contacts" section, click on "New contact", and fill in the required
                            information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact with the
                            tasks on the board.
                        </p>

                <div class="item-cont">
                    <span class="item">3.</span>
                    <article>
                        <h4>Adding Cards</h4>
                        <p>
                            Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual
                            tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the
                            task details in the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Moving Cards</h4>
                        <p>
                            As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging
                            and dropping the card from one list to another.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Deleting Cards</h4>
                        <p>
                            Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it. Deleting a
                            card will permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards,
                            as this action is irreversible.<br>
                            <br>
